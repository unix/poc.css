  <h3>List</h3>
  <p>
    Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding marker, such as a number
    or letter. The ol and ul elements may nest as deeply as desired, alternating
    between ol and ul however you like.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Steps in a recipe</li>
    <li>Turn-by-turn directions</li>
    <li>
      The list of ingredients in decreasing proportion on nutrition information
      labels
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The ol HTML element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a
    numbered list. To determine which list to use, try changing the order of the list
    items; if the meaning changes, use the ol element — otherwise you can use ul.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, mix eggs, milk, and oil.</li>
    <li>Stir both mixtures together.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill muffin tray 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>Bake for 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <h3>Button</h3>
  <p>
    The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a
    mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once
    activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a
    dialog.
  </p>
  <button>Submit</button>
  <span style="margin-right: 10px"></span>
  <button class="secondary">Mint</button>
  <span style="margin-right: 10px"></span>
  <button disabled>Login</button>
  <span style="margin-right: 10px"></span>
  <button class="secondary" disabled>Login</button>

  <h3>Image</h3>
  <p>
    The figure HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an
    optional caption, which is specified using the figcaption element. The figure,
    its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
  </p>
  <figure class="lg">
    <img src="demo.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Macbook on the table.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>

  <h3>Content</h3>
  <p>
    The <code>blockquote</code> HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an
    extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes
    for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using
    the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using
    the <code>cite</code> element.
  </p>

      "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either
      within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of
      the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created
      by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
    </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>
    The details HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which information is
    visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label
    must be provided using the summary element. A disclosure widget is typically
    presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to indicate
    open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. The contents of the
    summary element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.

      memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well as
      some form of output device is recommended.

  <h3>Table</h3>
  <p>
    A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). A
    table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of
    connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age,
    or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.

  <h3>Form</h3>
  <p>
    As web developers, it's important that we never assume that people will know all
    the things that we know. The diversity of people using the web—and by extension
    your website—practically guarantees that some of your site's visitors will have
    some variation in thought processes and/or circumstances that leads them to
    interpret your forms very differently from you without clear and
    properly-presented labels.
